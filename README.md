# Project1_Penn_Bootcamp
Project 1 collaborated by Israa Adam, Marina Connolly, Jennifer Giraldo Davila, Alexandra Martinez and Jillian Walter

This project explores Emissions Rates and Mortality Rates by European countries, to see if there is a relationship between Emissions created by Energy, Manufacturing, Transportation, etc. in high income countries and the mortality rates for Respiratory diseases for the last 5 years. 

In this folder, you can find our Jupyter Notebook with full cleaning and analysis, supporting CSV files, and final presentation shared with the class. 

**Research Overview and Questions**

Context:
Urban economic development often drives productivity and growth, but it can also contribute to increased pollution levels, affecting human health and environmental sustainability.
Hypothesis:
Higher income levels in capital cities are correlated with increased emission rates due to industrial and transportation activities. However, wealthier cities might also adopt more green technologies and stricter environmental regulations that reduce the overall environmental impact compared to lower-income cities. Although these cities produce more emissions, we are curious to see if that impacts higher levels of respiratory illness within its citizens.

- How do emission levels vary among countries with different income levels in Europe and Central Asia?
- What are the top emissions driving countries and which industries drive the most emissions?
- Does location (latitude/longitude) impact emission amounts?
- Which countries are most impacted by Respiratory illness in Europe? Which illnesses drive the highest mortality rate?
- How do emission levels correlate with mortality rates due to air pollution related conditions?

**About our Data Sources**
- Topline country data from World Bank Open Data: API Source used to pull all European countries and their descriptive data around location (latitude and longitude), capital city, and income level (all falling into “high” in respect to all other countries in the world
- European Emissions Data from European Environment Agency: downloadable CSV providing detailed data around Emissions by country in metric tons: total emissions data, top industry drivers, type of pollutants (i.e. CO2, N2O, etc.)
- Respiratory Health Data from World Health Organization: provides country-level data on all respiratory illnesses and mortality rates

**Conclusion**
Analyses proved that there is no relationship between latitude and longitude and emissions, and there is also no relationship between emissions and mortality rate, prompting potential for future research around lifestyle, drug and alcohol use and diet that may be contributing to increased mortality rates in some countries vs. others.
